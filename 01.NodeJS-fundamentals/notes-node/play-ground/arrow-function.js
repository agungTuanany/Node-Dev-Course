// or

/**
explaining differences between regular function and arrow-function

regular function:
    sayHi: function () {

    }

arrow-function :
    sayHI: () => {

    }

@param sayHi Here we try to define a method inside an object
, sayHi method I assign it to arrow function,

Since arrow-function do not bind 'this' keyword. Keyword 'this' is binding in parrent function, since theresn't parrent function 'this' keyword referred to global 'this' keyword or undefined.

Arrow function also do not bind argumnet-array.

@param sayHiAlt ES6 provide us new feature to make method inside an object, the way is:
    // just put a singgle white space after you methodName
    methodNmae () {
              ^
}

cause much more error message when you want to try make a method inside an objects by using arrow-function.  look at sayHiAltt method.

    name: "john",
    sayhi: () => {
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);

    },
    sayHiAlt () {
        console.log(`Hi, I'm calling you from sayhiAlt method ${this.name}`);

user.sayHiAlt(1,2, 'john', 4,5, 'sarah');
